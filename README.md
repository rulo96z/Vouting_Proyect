Create a voting dapp that will take in a unique verified public address that will be given a single coin to place a vote. The coin will be sent to a unique account associated with the vote that was placed. The vote will be signed and sent to the unique account. Then using that we can obtain a balance of those minted tokens for each unique account to get a live chart for the poll.
